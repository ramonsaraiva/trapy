# Requirements #

If you used a **nix based system you should already have Python installed. You will then need the following third-party libraries:**

  * [Python 2.5](http://python.org)
  * [BeautifulSoup](http://crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup)
  * [ClientCookie](http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/ClientCookie)
  * [ClientForm](http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/ClientForm)

If you are on Windows, download and install [setuptools](http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.5/s/setuptools/setuptools-0.6c8.win32-py2.5.exe#md5=963088fdb1c7332b1cbd4885876e077a), which will include EasyInstall. Then open command prompt, and enter the following:

```
easy_install BeautifulSoup
easy_install ClientCookie
easy_install ClientForm
```

If all goes well, you should now have all the requirements for trapy.
